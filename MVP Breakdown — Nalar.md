# MVP Breakdown — Nalar  
*Student-First Assistive Research Companion*

---

## 🎯 MVP Goal

Help a student go from:

> “I don’t know what research to do, and I don’t really understand the papers”

to:

> “I have a clear research direction, I understand my papers, and I know what to do next”

— **without writing the skripsi or thesis for them**.

Nalar supports **reasoning, clarity, and confidence**, not content generation.

---

## 🧠 Core Student Problems

Students struggle because they:
- don’t know how to choose a feasible research topic  
- read papers without truly understanding them  
- can’t clearly explain methods or results  
- feel lost about the next step  
- rely on ChatGPT but still feel unsure  

**The real problem:**  
Students don’t know if their *reasoning* is correct.

## 🧭 Nalar’s MVP Is One Continuous Flow

Nalar is not a collection of tools.

It is **one guided journey with three moments**:

1. Topic Refinement  
2. Paper Understanding & Comparison  
3. Next-Step Guidance  

Each moment produces a **clear thinking artifact**.

## 🚀 Core MVP Features

## 1️⃣ Topic Refinement Coach (Brainstorming)

**Purpose:**  
Help students who don’t yet have a clear topic find a realistic research direction.

This is **not a topic generator**.  
It is a **guided reasoning process**.

### How it works
Nalar asks structured questions about:
- interests and academic field  
- context and constraints  
- data availability and timeline  
- what the student is curious about  

Nalar proposes **2–3 research directions**, not full titles.

### Output: Topic Card
Each Topic Card includes:
- working research focus  
- draft research questions  
- key concepts / variables  
- plausible methods  
- feasibility notes  
- what a supervisor may challenge  

**Student outcome:**  
“I finally know what I’m researching.”

## 2️⃣ Paper Workspace  
*(Understand & Compare)*

### 2.1 Paper Understanding Companion

Students upload a paper.

Nalar explains:
- what the paper is really about  
- why the chosen method matters  
- which variables are important  
- what the results actually mean  
- common student misunderstandings  
- key quotes with page references  

Tone:
> Calm, clear, supervisor-like.

### Output: Paper Card
- method  
- sample / data  
- key variables  
- main findings  
- limitations  
- relevance to the topic  

**Student outcome:**  
“I can explain this paper without guessing.”

---

### 2.2 Paper Comparison (Lean)

Students select **2–3 papers**.

Nalar highlights:
- real points of agreement  
- method differences  
- reasons for conflicting results  
- strengths and weaknesses  

### Output: Comparison Card
- structured comparison  
- method trade-offs  
- insight prompts  

**Student outcome:**  
“I understand how these papers differ.”

---

## 3️⃣ Next-Step Research Guide

**Purpose:**  
Help students move forward without feeling lost.

Based on the student’s:
- Topic Card  
- Paper Cards  
- current stage  

Nalar provides:
- 3 recommended next actions  
- why each matters  
- common mistakes at this stage  

No rigid checklists.

**Student outcome:**  
“I know what to do next.”

---

## 🧭 First-Time Experience

When a student opens Nalar, they see one question:

> **“Do you already have a research topic?”**

- No → Topic Refinement Coach  
- Yes → Upload first paper  

No dashboards.  
No setup friction.

---

## 🔍 What Nalar Does NOT Do

Nalar does not:
- write skripsi or thesis text  
- generate literature reviews  
- fabricate citations  
- make decisions for the student  

Students always:
- reason  
- decide  
- write themselves  

---

## 🧱 Technical Scope (MVP)

### Backend
- PDF ingestion & retrieval

## 📈 MVP Success Metrics

Nalar is successful if:
- students complete the full flow in ≤ 45 minutes  
- students upload more than one paper  
- students say Nalar explains better than ChatGPT  
- students feel confident explaining their research  

---

## 🏁 MVP Summary

Nalar helps students:
- reason through research ideas  
- understand academic papers deeply  
- compare studies intelligently
