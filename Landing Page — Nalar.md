## Research Is Confusing — Even for Smart Students

Struggling with research doesn’t mean you’re lazy or incapable.

Most students feel stuck because:
- Academic papers are dense and hard to decode  
- Methods sections feel impossible to explain  
- Different papers sound similar — or contradict each other  
- Supervisors expect understanding, not summaries  
- ChatGPT gives answers, but not confidence  

The result:  
You read more, ask more questions — and still feel unsure.

## Nalar Helps You Think Like a Researcher

It won’t write your skripsi or thesis for you.

Instead, Nalar helps you:
- make sense of research ideas  
- understand what papers are *actually doing*  
- see meaningful differences between studies  
- know what to work on next  

Think of Nalar as:
> **A calm supervisor who explains things clearly.**

- **Yes** → Upload a paper you don’t understand  

No setup.

Just clarity.
